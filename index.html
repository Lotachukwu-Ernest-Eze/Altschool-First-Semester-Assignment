        <h2>Why AltSchool?</h2>
        <p>I joined AltSchool Africa to learn software engineering because I believe that technology is a crucial tool for making education more accessible. With the skills I acquire, I intend to develop innovative solutions that will support educational initiatives across Africa. My aim in the School of Engineering program is to gain the knowledge necessary to build and scale educational platforms that can reach diverse populations, particularly in underprivileged communities.</p>
